# Tinder,But Better
This repository contains a Python-based matching application that calculates and displays user matches based on similarity scores. The app is modular, with separate files for data models, schemas, similarity score calculations, and user interactions.

## Project Structure
### Folders

- **`__pycache__/`**:
  - Contains cached bytecode files automatically generated by Python. These files help speed up the loading time of modules by avoiding recompilation.

- **`static/`**:
  - Stores static assets such as CSS, JavaScript, and image files used by the application, particularly for the web interface.

- **`templates/`**:
  - Holds HTML template files used to render dynamic web pages. These templates are filled with data and used to generate the HTML served to users.'

### Files
- **`data.py`**: 
  - Handles data-related operations, such as loading, processing, or interacting with the database. This file includes the initial data population for database tables.

- **`identity.py`**: 
  - Manages user identity and authentication processes. Recent updates added comments to improve code documentation.

- **`main.py`**: 
  - The main entry point of the application. Running this file initiates the application. Recent changes include adding a location filtering function.

- **`model.py`**: 
  - Defines the data models used throughout the application. These models represent the structure and relationships of the data. Recent updates added comments for clarity.

- **`schema.py`**: 
  - Defines the schema or blueprint of the data models, ensuring data integrity and consistency. A recent update added a foreign key constraint to one of the models.

- **`similarity_score.py`**: 
  - Contains the logic for calculating similarity scores between users or entities. These scores are used to determine the best matches. This file was recently updated as part of a merge process.

- **`user.py`**: 
  - Handles operations related to user management, such as creating and updating user profiles. The most recent update added comments for better understanding of the code.

- **`user_interaction.py`**: 
  - Manages interactions between the user and the application, including collecting user input and displaying results. The file was updated to include functionality for viewing matches.



## Features
### 1. User Profile Management

- **Profile Attributes:**
  - Each user profile contains the following attributes:
    - `user_id` (unique identifier)
    - `name`
    - `age`
    - `gender`
    - `location`
    - `interests` (list of interests)

- **Profile Actions:**
  - **Create a new user profile**
  - **View existing user profiles**
  - **Edit user profile details**
  - **Delete user profile**

### 2. User Interaction

- **Interaction Attributes:**
  - Tracks user interactions with the following attributes:
    - `liked_users` (list of user IDs that the user has liked)
    - `disliked_users` (list of user IDs that the user has disliked)
    - `matches` (list of user IDs that are mutual likes, based on a sophisticated matching algorithm)

- **Interaction Actions:**
  - **Like a user profile**
  - **Dislike a user profile**
  - **View matches** (based on user interactions, remembers likes and dislikes)

### 3. Data Storage and Management

- **Data Structures:**
  - Utilizes Python lists, tuples, and dictionaries to manage user profiles and interactions.

- **Database Integration:**
  - Implements a SQLite database to store user profiles and interactions.
  - Performs CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using SQL queries.
  - Uses the `sqlite3` library for database interactions.
 
### 4. Graphic User Interface (GUI)

- **User Commands:**
  - `create_user`: Create a new user profile
  - `view_profiles`: View all user profiles
  - `edit_profile`: Edit an existing user profile
  - `delete_profile`: Delete a user profile
  - `like_user`: Like a user profile
  - `dislike_user`: Dislike a user profile
  - `view_matches`: View matched user profiles
