# Tinder,But Better
This repository contains a Python-based matching application that calculates and displays user matches based on similarity scores. The app is modular, with separate files for data models, schemas, similarity score calculations, and user interactions.

## Project Structure
### Folders

- **`__pycache__/`**:
  - Contains cached bytecode files automatically generated by Python. These files help speed up the loading time of modules by avoiding recompilation.

- **`static/`**:
  - Stores static assets such as CSS, JavaScript, and image files used by the application, particularly for the web interface.

- **`templates/`**:
  - Holds HTML template files used to render dynamic web pages. These templates are filled with data and used to generate the HTML served to users.'

### Files
- **`data.py`**: 
  - Handles data-related operations, such as loading, processing, or interacting with the database. This file includes the initial data population for database tables.

- **`identity.py`**: 
  - Manages user identity and authentication processes. Recent updates added comments to improve code documentation.

- **`main.py`**: 
  - The main entry point of the application. Running this file initiates the application. Recent changes include adding a location filtering function.

- **`model.py`**: 
  - Defines the data models used throughout the application. These models represent the structure and relationships of the data. Recent updates added comments for clarity.

- **`schema.py`**: 
  - Defines the schema or blueprint of the data models, ensuring data integrity and consistency. A recent update added a foreign key constraint to one of the models.

- **`similarity_score.py`**: 
  - Contains the logic for calculating similarity scores between users or entities. These scores are used to determine the best matches. This file was recently updated as part of a merge process.

- **`user.py`**: 
  - Handles operations related to user management, such as creating and updating user profiles. The most recent update added comments for better understanding of the code.

- **`user_interaction.py`**: 
  - Manages interactions between the user and the application, including collecting user input and displaying results. The file was updated to include functionality for viewing matches.



## Features

                                                                                                                                                                  -**`viewMatches`**: Select and display all matches for a user.

Class UserProfile Usage: \
    -**`createUser`**: Create a new user profile. \
                                         -**`viewUser`**: Select user's info of a user.\
  -**`editUser`**: Update user profile infor.\
  -**`deleteUser`**: Remove a user profile.
